You have many friends. boys, and girls.

Also, you may have a boy/girlfriend or husband/wife.

Most people have heavy argue with their partner, but simpler argue with their friends! Why?

Because partners **expect** from each other. Yes, this is the only thing that causes to a heavy argument in couples.

We have long life friends, but our relationship with our love is about six month.
Many girls/boys were our social friends; but when they became our love our relation broke.

Why we can be in a long relationship with our social friends with short annoyance; but we cut with our love very fast?

Recently I engaged (congratulate myself).
I was in the relationship with my love from February (2018).
When our relationship became serious, our argument increases.
So, we imagine that we aren't fit together.
But that was a **mistake**.
Our expectation from each other was high.

I decided to decrease my expectation and enjoy my relationship.

Now I'm happy and every day that comes, make me happier in my relationship.
When we get in trouble, I behave with her like a social friend in expectation and like a long life wife in love. So, everything gets better.
There is no heavy argument, no annoyance, no huff, because there is no over-expectation.

Use this simple trick to have a better relation.
