title: Stand-up Meeting
---

A **stand-up meeting** (or simply **stand-up**) is a meeting in which attendees typically participate while standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings short.

Holding a daily stand-up meeting is a great way for your team to touch base and stay on the same page without introducing time-sucking status meetings into your workplace.

## How to run a stand-up
### Step 1: Please stand up
All team members get together in the **morning** and **stand up** for the duration of the meeting. that way you **keep the meeting short**, because no one likes to stand.

### Step 2: Put your game face on
When people know what to expect, they tend to lose interest. Because daily stand-ups are routine by nature, you need to vary the routine in order to keep people engaged. For example, if your typical stand-up agenda includes going around the room clockwise and hearing from each person, think about putting everyone’s name in a hat and drawing to see who goes next. You can even make it more interesting by giving out prizes, such as a Starbucks gift card or some other [tchotchke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchotchke) for the “last one standing” (last name picked). You may even want to take a note from "The Pee-Wee Herman Show" and have a daily **secret word** to keep people listening closely.

### Step 3: Three Questions
Scrum-style stand-ups convene daily to re-plan in-progress development.[7] Though it may not be practical to limit all discussion to these three questions, the objective is to create a new sprint plan within the time box (less than 15 minutes), while deferring discussions about impediments until after the event is complete. Team members briefly (a maximum of one minute per team member) address three questions as input to this planning:

1. What did I do yesterday (last meeting) that helped the development team meet the sprint goal?
2. What will I do today (until the next meeting) to help the development team meet the sprint goal?
3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?

Whereas Kanban-style daily stand-ups focus more on:
1. What obstacles are impeding my progress?
2. (looking at the board from right to left) What has progressed?


### Step 3: Keep it short
Topics doesn't have to be a novel. just a short list of the highlights. no one likes to get caught up in unimportant details. :unamused:

You can use a 10-minute "Egg Timer" or "Sandglass Hourglass" for manage and limiting stand-up time.

### Step 4: Go on topic
Often, people may be tempted to go off on different topics while they have the group’s ears, but don’t let them. Cut in whenever you notice the meeting is headed off-course and let that person know you appreciate them bringing up “Topic X,” but it’s a discussion for another time. To prevent people from getting upset over being redirected, you can let them know you care about Topic X by adding it to a whiteboard of "Topics for Later Discussion."

## Avoidance alert
4 bad habits that derail scrum meetings.

### Waiting around for your team

Always start your meeting at the set time. Those who miss it or who are late will feel guilty and try harder to make it to the next one.

### Introducing new ideas

The scrum meeting is not a planning meeting. Introducing new topics will divert attention away from answering your strict 3 question agenda.

### Letting people ramble

We get it — asking people to stop talking can be awkward. In general, adhering to the rule, “everything you say should be valuable to everyone in the room” will keep rambling down. If that’s not enough, another simple fix is to set a strict time limit for each speaker.   

### Abandoning team communication in favor of the stand up

The scrum meeting should not be the sole means of team communication. It’s easy to wait around for the next meeting to bring up an issue, but this just slows down your team and bloats the stand up meeting.


in 5 to 10 minutes, the whole team is totally in sync, and avoids costly miscommunications.
