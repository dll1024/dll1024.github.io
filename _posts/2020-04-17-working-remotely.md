## What Is It

Remote work has many other names, such as Telework, Working from Home (WFH), and so on.

I can define this terminology in one sentence:

> When you don't have to go to your office to do your job, you are working remotely.

_THAT'S IT_

More description would be redundancy.

## Benefits

After knowing what remote work is, you are going to find what its benefits are and how can it help us.

### For Company

Most companies, as I have experienced, are against working remotely,
because they think that they need to see their employees when they are working.
Maybe they can't trust their employees.
They believe in synergy in working on-site.
However, the problem is that you can be present whole the day in the office, but work less than an hour!

If the employer can measure your efficiency well, they can measure it remotely too.
In all Tech companies (and non-Tech ones) there are task management tools for managing projects and tasks.
It shows 3 situations:

1. What to do?
1. What every employee is doing?
1. What is done?

As an employer, boss, team lead, or manager
you can see what's going on by observing the board on the screen instead of watching employees and saying
"Yay, they are in their seats, and it seems they're working!"

Also, there are some economic goals in remote work.
Imagine a company that is fully remote.
There are successful examples of it.
I remember two of them at this time: [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) and [Buffer](https://buffer.com/).
Automattic is one of the first fully remote companies, I guess. OK, keep imagining!

There is no office or big office for working at. So there is no cost for it,
and you don't have to have some on-site perks.

Also, you can hire from everywhere, not only the city your office is in it.
So, you can hire from where employees are cheaper, especially if you are in a high-cost city,
and you have more candidates to hire.

Another benefit of remote work is that you can prevent (or decrease) office relationships (because there is no office).
Office relationship (or Office romance) is a situation in which two members of a business in an office become romantically linked with one another.
You can search for the dangers of this situation for the company and employees.
Some companies have a rule: if you marry your colleague, one of you has to leave the company.

### For Employee

If you find the benefits of working remotely, you never want to work on-site.

How much time do you lose in traffic jam? 2 hours on average! Does the company compensate for that?

How do you feel after that? You would smell like exhaust fumes.

You wouldn't eat breakfast because you are in a hurry to get to the office on time?

You don't have to move to the office every day in remote work.

Would you always like to order expensive and low-quality foods for lunch? Or eat the food of the night before?

You can eat or cook a fresh meal like your weekends when you work remotely.

You have an open office and when somebody gets a cold, everyone is at risk of getting infected?

The office is hot for you? Is it too cold because the air conditioner is always turned on?

Tired of noises in the office? Do you hate putting on headphones all the day?

You are safe at home. You can choose the temperature as you like, Turn your music player on,
and start your work after a delicious breakfast.

Is this city too crowded? or have high costs? Work everywhere you want. Location doesn't matter.
You can earn like an engineer in the capital, and spend like the lord of a village.

You don't have to leave your parents and travel to a city for better opportunities.

Also, imagine you can travel to Bali Islands and keep working and earning.

### For Society and the Nature

The most important benefit for the public is decreasing the traffic jams and air pollution.
All of us almost know how many people commute every day.
Isn't it a good way to decrease it?

### Last Words

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, there were many companies and people that found the benefits of remote work,
but these days, many people have to stay at home. Therefore, working remotely is bolder than before,
and maybe it's the start of a revolution in the way people work.

As we experienced in our current company (that I tried many times to tell them benefits of remote work),
our colleagues that stayed at home and worked remotely, they benefit from  a higher level of job satisfaction.

I hope more companies, including our company, find that working remotely is a good choice for them and their employees,
and brings many benefits and improves the standards for their work family and society.
