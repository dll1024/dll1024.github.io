## What is it

Remote work has many alternative names, such as Telework, Working from Home (WFH), and more...

I can describe this terminology in one sentence:

> When you don't have to go to your office to do your job, you are working remotely.

_THATS IT_

More description is overtalking.

## Benefits

After knowing what is remote work, you are going to find what's its benefits and how can it help us.

### For Company

Most companies (as I experienced) oppose starting to working remotely.
Because they think that we need to see our employees when they are working. Maybe they can't trust their employees.
They believe in Synergy in working on-site.
But the trust is that you can be present whole the day in the office, but work less than an hour!

If the employer can measure your useful working hours in office **correctly**, they can measure it for remote employees too.
In all Tech companies (and also non-Tech ones) there are task management tools for managing projects and tasks.
It shows 3 situations:

1. What to do
1. What every employee is doing
1. What is done

As an employer, boss, team lead or manager, you can see what's going on by observing the board on the screen instead of watching employees and saying "Yay, they are in their seats and seems they're working!"

Also, there are some economic goals in remote work.
Imagine a company that is fully remote.
There are successful examples of it.
I remember two of them at this time: [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) and [Buffer](https://buffer.com/).
Automattic is one of the first fully remote companies, I guess. OK, keep imagining.

There is no office or big office for working on it. So there is no cost for it!
And you don't have to have some in-office perks.

Also, you can hire from everywhere, not only the city that your office is in it.
So, you can hire from where employees are cheaper. Especially, if you are in a high-cost city.
And you have more choices to hire.

Another benefit of remote work is that you can prevent (or decrease) office relationships (because there is no office).
Office relationship (or Office romance) is a situation in which two members of a business in an office or on a shop floor become romantically linked with one another.
You can search about the dangers of this situation for the company and employees to learn more.
Some companies have a rule: if you marry your colleague, one of you has to leave the company.

### For Employee

If you find the benefits of working remotely, you never want to work on-site. I can count them.

How much time do you lose in the traffic? 2 hours on average! Does the company spend you for it?

How do you feel after traffic? Smell worse because of exhaust fumes?

You don't eat breakfast because you are in a hurry to reach the office on time?

You don't have to move to the office every day in remote work.

Always order expensive and low-quality foods for launch? Eat last night or freeze meal?

You can eat or cook a fresh meal like weekends in remote work.

You have an open office and when somebody got a cold, everyone is at risk of getting infected?

The office is hot for you? It's too cold because the air conditioner is always turned on?

Tired of noises in office? Do you hate putting on a headphone whole the day?

You are safe at home. Select the temperature yourself, Turn your music player on,
and start your work after a delicious breakfast.

This city is too crowded? or have high costs? Work everywhere you want. Location doesn't matter.
You can earn like an engineer in country capital and spend like the lord of a village.

You don't have to leave your parents and travel to a city with better opportunities.

and Imagine you can travel to Bali Islands and keep working and earning.

### For Society and Nature

The best result of work remote work for the public is decreasing traffic jams and air pollution.
All of us know how many people travel every day for reaching their office and come back to their homes.
Isn't it enough to decrease it?

### Last Words

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, there were many companies and people that found the benefits of remote work.
But these days many people have to stay at home. So, working remotely is bolder than before.
And maybe it's the start of a revolution in working type.

As we experienced in our current company (that I tried many times to tell them the benefits of remote work),
our colleagues that stay at home and work remotely fill better in working life.

I hope more companies (including our company) find that working remotely is a good choice for them and their employees,
and brings many benefits and standards for their work family and society.
